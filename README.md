# Goal

Goal is to develop a system for an Tactical Planing Framework. When we mean 'tactical', we mean that it takes every part of the life inside the framework itself. Like a tactical black-ops squad for atomical level missons. Goal is implementing the framework itself to life. Not that ADHD friendly but I am a person suffers from it, so my goal is to optimize myself and try to create a framework for it. 

# Current status

General framework created but to create an enviorment, I need to define the system in more detail. Currently up-to-date version is 1.0
